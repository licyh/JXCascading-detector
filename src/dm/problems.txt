1. The class that implements Runnable interface does not create a independent thread.
   In current implementation, we only monitor subclass of Thread and its start function as a thread creation.
   Threadpool is a kind of Runnable interface? Consider this case?


2. While figure out thread.start, I only consider invokevirtual case. It seems that invokeinterface is impossible to start a new thread.
